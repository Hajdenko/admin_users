# admin_users
Simple script for showing details about player.
This script is not my, but I highly modified it.

Commands:
* /users -- this turns on only very needed information about the player
* /advancedusers -- this turns on every almost every information about the player
* /usersfullrad -- this enables full radius so you can see players from a bigger distance
* /usersreload -- basically, it reloads the script in case something is nil.
